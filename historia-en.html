  <h2>History</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2014</strong> &nbsp; The idea of consolidating a company dedicated to specialized and professional quality services is born. The idea is solidified and operations begin as an individual entity.</li>
    <li><strong>2015</strong> &nbsp; Operations continue and the administrative team grows in the commercial and engineering areas. Services are sold to internationally recognized companies.</li>
    <li><strong>2017</strong> &nbsp; A department dedicated to entertainment and events is created.</li>
    <li><strong>2018</strong> &nbsp; Efforts are consolidated to expand services nationwide with major companies, and more services are added to the catalog.</li>
    <li><strong>2019</strong> &nbsp; The commercial name DYMIEC S.A. de C.V. is adopted for business purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>2020</strong> &nbsp; Deals are closed with globally recognized companies. We continue with our company's special characteristic: customer service and trust in our services.</li>
    <li><strong>2021</strong> &nbsp; We continue providing services to both large and small clients, as the companyâ€™s philosophy is that no job is too small â€” all work is equally important.</li>
    <li><strong>2022</strong> &nbsp; Deals are finalized with companies like Pastes Kikos, Constructora FM, Chedraui, and Farmacias Similares for industrial supplies and construction of production plants.</li>
    <li><strong>2023</strong> &nbsp; Currently, DYMIEC is still seeking new projects and services to offer, eager to grow as a company, striving to be the main supplier for major corporations â€” always focusing on customer satisfaction and well-being.</li>
